Markdown is a simple markup language that allows easy formatting. In Museum Wiki,
we allow users to format the description section using Markdown. Here is a brief
example of how it works. If you are experienced with Markdown, feel free to delete
everything here and start writing your own Markdown text.

## Heading

Use hashtags for article headings.

## Text

Example formatting options are: italics with an *asterisk* or _underscores_,
bold with **two asterisks** or __two underscores__.
